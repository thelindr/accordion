      <div class="title" id="section1">What is JavaScript?</div>
      <div class="description">

      <div class="title" id="section2">Is JavaScript Hard to Learn?</div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>The degree of difficulty in learning JavaScript depends on the level of knowledge you bring to it. Because the most common way to run JavaScript is as part of a web page, you must first understand HTML. In addition, a familiarity with CSS is also useful because CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) provides the formatting engine behind the HTML.</p>
